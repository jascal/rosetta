# `rosetta.pack` — the expert-packaging layer

The *factory* that turns a corpus (+ an optional model) into a **deployable bounded-expert package** for the thin
sgiandubh runtime to serve. rosetta is the sole builder; sgiandubh builds nothing (see
[`../../CONVERGENCE.md`](../../CONVERGENCE.md)). This layer **depends on** the minimization core (`py/`, via `cover.py`);
the core never imports `pack` (enforced by `tests/test_pack.py`).

## Use `build_expert()`, not the modules directly

```python
from pack import build_expert
build_expert(out, *, corpus=…, bundle=…, questions=…, adapter=…, cover=…, fieldrun=…, …)
```

`build_expert()` is the single entry — it orchestrates the modules in the right order and emits the package. Three shapes:

| shape | inputs | produces |
|---|---|---|
| **model-distilled** | `bundle` + `questions` (+ `corpus`, `cover=True`) | curated answers + grounding (+ cover) |
| **model-free** | `adapter=…` + `adapter_source=…` | citable passages + grounding (no cover, no curated) |
| **corpus-only** | `corpus` | grounding + empty index |

Call the individual modules (`answers`, `grounding`, `cover`, `adapters.*`) only when scripting a non-standard build.
The extractor is **named explicitly** — `fieldrun=…` or `$FIELDRUN` (no hard-coded path, no PATH discovery), so a build
is reproducible.

## Composition — cover-first (why)

Every serving tier is ultimately a lookup, so *fast* is a given; the discriminators are **accurate** (abstain / cite /
no-hallucinate) and **smart** (generalize). So the package is composed:

> **cover** (smart: causal idioms + gated n-grams) → **curated answers** (gated FAQ) → **grounding** (citation;
> retrieval hard-gated at the runtime) → **abstain**

- **gram is dropped** — the cover's gated n-grams subsume it; shipping bare n-grams trades accuracy for cheap coverage.
  `gram.py` is kept *only* to run the coverage-parity check, then deleted.
- **grounding is citation-first** — its job is to attach the source passage; retrieval-as-answer is a hard-gated fallback
  at the runtime (kills the wrong-but-cited / off-domain-leak failures).

## The emitted package

| file(s) | tier | built by | optional? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | cover (causal idioms + gated n-grams) | `cover.py` (needs a model) | model-free → absent |
| `index.json` + `facts_*/` | curated Q&A | `answers.py` (needs a model) | model-free → empty |
| `knowledge.tsv` (+ `wordvec.txt`) | grounding / citation | `grounding.py` | present if a corpus is given |
| `rules.txt` | model-free citable passages | `adapters/normrules.py` | adapter builds only |

Optional components are detected by **presence** (a model-free expert ships no `manifest`/curated items). `build_expert`
emits the **package only** — it does *not* build the sgiandubh runtime binary (that stays sgiandubh's job; the package
is the only interface).

## A build is a reproducible experiment

What an expert build *is*, how its quality is measured (scorecard: coverage / precision / abstain, hard-fail gated), and
how corpus + experimental design + benchmark targets drive it: see [`../../EXPERTS.md`](../../EXPERTS.md). The
`pack.eval` scorecard + spec loader land in a later phase.
